## Contributions

Anyone is welcome to contribute via GitHub pull requests.

This is a rough outline of what a contributor's workflow looks like:

*    Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work (usually master).
*    Make commits of logical units.
*    Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format:  <type> (<scope>) : <summary>, where type can be [fix, feat(ure), test, docs]
*    Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
*    Make sure the tests pass, and add any new tests as appropriate.
*    Submit a pull request to the original repository.

Thanks for your contributions!
